            "identification": "Atlantic salmon can be hard to identify. Identifying Atlantic salmon, Chinook salmon, coho salmon, rainbow (steelhead) trout and brown trout.Adults have black spots on sides, mostly above lateral line. Dark pectoral fins, caudal fin may be slightly forked, nine or 10 rays in anal fin. Two dorsal fins, including one adipose fin. Caudal peduncle is generally narrow and tapered. Narrow pointed, vomerine tongue with four to six small teeth. Jaw usually extends to rear edge of eye or slightly beyond.The primary fishery is in the St. Mary's River, while the state maintains a fishery in Torch Lake (Antrim Co) with stocked fish, as well as Lexington Harbor, Thunder Bay River and Au Sable River each spring under an experimental stocking program. Atlantic salmon can be caught in Lake Huron, the St. Marys River and even the St. Clair River by Port Huron. Fall returns of spawning fish occur at each location, primarily in Oct.-Dec. Anglers troll for them using downriggers, though some anglers drift in current below the rapids, casting with streamers or soft-plastic jerk baits. In the spring, Atlantics prefer the upper, warmer layers of the lake near shore. In the summer they retreat to deeper, cooler water. When fall approaches they again come shoreward as they head toward their spawning stream as the cycle repeats.Have you caught an Atlantic salmon?

While on their spawning run they do not feed, but will often strike out of aggression.Spawning migrations vary by stream of origin, but the St. Mary's River run typically begins in mid-summer and runs until November when spawning commences. The female chooses a gravel-bottomed riffle above or below a pool, and digs a nest, or redd. As she lays her eggs in this depression, the male simultaneously releases sperm. Then the female pushes gravel back over the eggs. When spawning is finished the adults may rest in the river for some time and then return to the lake. Atlantic salmon can potentially spawn multiple years.Eggs hatch the following spring, and emerge from the gravel a few weeks later. At that stage of their development, they stay in the stream's fast water, eating and growing for 2-3 months, or until they are about 6 inches long. Then they move downriver to the Great Lakes, where they grow rapidly, and weigh 3-6 pounds after one year. Some return to their spawning grounds after this first year while others wait an extra year or more, growing to a weight of around 6 pounds.One of the most prized game fish in the world, Atlantic salmon are known for their leaping and fighting ability. Although they were once native to Lake Ontario, they were extirpated from the Great Lakes before 1900. They were first successfully introduced to the other Great Lakes in 1972 when Michigan stocked around 20,000 young Atlantic salmon in the Boyne and Au Sable rivers.

They can be caught with a wide range of artificial lures, and can be taken on virtually any live bait. Bass fishermen typically cast all manner of lures, from topwater plugs to bottom-bumpers (such as jigs or plastic worms) with diving plugs, swim baits, spoons or spinnerbaits used in between.

            "identification": "Brook trout have a long, streamlined body with a large mouth that extends past the eye. Color variations include olive, blue-gray or black above with a silvery white belly and wormlike markings (vermiculation pattern) along the back. They have red spots sometimes surrounded by bluish halos on their sides. The lower fins have a white front edge followed by black and the remainder being reddish orange. The tail fin is square or slightly forked. During fall breeding time, male brook trout will develop a slight hooked jaw and become very bright orange-red along the lower sides which is highlighted by a black vertical stripe along the belly.Brook trout are ready biters and they can be caught by using various baits and lures including worms, crickets, grasshoppers, wet and dry flies, spoons and spinners. They can be found in deep holes and under the cover of logs or overhanging banks in many streams where they often pursued by anglers drifting worms along the bottom. Small spoons, spinners and jigs are the most popular spinning lures. Brook trout are more diurnal than other trout, giving them a reputation among fly fishermen as \"gentlemen trout,\" and are perhaps the least discriminatory.The Black River system, in the northeastern Lower Peninsula, enjoys a reputation as being among the best brook trout streams in Michigan. Brookies are found in most major trout stream systems, but by summer, they have often migrated to the headwaters of the tributaries in search of colder water. Brook trout are widespread across the northern portion of the state, especially in the Upper Peninsula, where any stream that runs clear and cold is likely to hold a population of brook trout.\u00a0Review Fishing Guide for current rules and regulations \u00bb\u00a0Brook trout have been described as voracious feeders with the potential to consume large numbers seasonally available mayflies, stoneflies and other aquatic insects as well as terrestrial insects. \u00a0However, they will often feed on whatever is most readily available like zooplankton, crustaceans, worms and fish.The brook trout is native to Michigan's waters and has been designated the state fish of Michigan. They can be found alongside rocks, under cover of logs and undercut banks, in cold water, spring-fed streams, rivers, lakes and in the Great Lakes. Larger brook trout often inhabit deep instream pools moving to shallow water feed. Spawning generally occurs in the months of October and November. Mature brook trout seek a gravel riffle area in spring-fed streams, seepage areas of ponds, lake shores with swift currents or groundwater seepages. Female brook trout use their tails to create a spawning bed (or redd). After spawning the female covers the eggs (up to 5,000 per female) with gravel. Brook trout eggs must stay silt free and get continuous amounts of oxygen rich water in order for the eggs to survive. Depending upon water temperatures, the egg incubation period is 3 to 4 months before hatching into sac fry, which remain in the redd until the yolk sac is absorbed. Brook trout take about 1.5 to 2.5 years to mature and they usually do not live longer than 6 years. Brook trout living in streams reach between 7 to 9 inches in length. Great Lake brook trout or coasters can attain larger sizes up to 25 inches and 10 pounds.Did you know the DNR rears brook trout at Marquette State Fish Hatchery?",

Brook trout are widespread across the northern portion of the state, especially in the Upper Peninsula, where any stream that runs clear and cold is likely to hold a population of brook trout.\u00a0Review Fishing Guide for current rules and regulations \u00bb\u00a0Brook trout have been described as voracious feeders with the potential to consume large numbers seasonally available mayflies, stoneflies and other aquatic insects as well as terrestrial insects. \u00a0However, they will often feed on whatever is most readily available like zooplankton, crustaceans, worms and fish.The brook trout is native to Michigan's waters and has been designated the state fish of Michigan. They can be found alongside rocks, under cover of logs and undercut banks, in cold water, spring-fed streams, rivers, lakes and in the Great Lakes. Larger brook trout often inhabit deep instream pools moving to shallow water feed. Spawning generally occurs in the months of October and November. Mature brook trout seek a gravel riffle area in spring-fed streams, seepage areas of ponds, lake shores with swift currents or groundwater seepages. Female brook trout use their tails to create a spawning bed (or redd). After spawning the female covers the eggs (up to 5,000 per female) with gravel. Brook trout eggs must stay silt free and get continuous amounts of oxygen rich water in order for the eggs to survive. Depending upon water temperatures, the egg incubation period is 3 to 4 months before hatching into sac fry, which remain in the redd until the yolk sac is absorbed. Brook trout take about 1.5 to 2.5 years to mature and they usually do not live longer than 6 years. Brook trout living in streams reach between 7 to 9 inches in length. Great Lake brook trout or coasters can attain larger sizes up to 25 inches and 10 pounds.Did you know the DNR rears brook trout at Marquette State Fish Hatchery?",

Learn more about identifying Atlantic salmon, Chinook salmon, coho salmon, rainbow (steelhead) trout and brown trout.Dorsal and adipose fin, broad square tongue with 11 to 12 large teeth, light pectoral fins, square tail, and nine to 10 rays in the anal fin.Lake-run browns are predominately silver in color and the body spots are often obscured in lake-dwellers compared to the resident stream dwellers. \u00a0The average lake run adult weighs eight pounds, although individuals can grow to be much larger.Brown trout provide good fishing in many, mostly northern Michigan, inland lakes. Anglers use a wide variety of methods, from fishing with live bait on the bottom to trolling with minnows or artificial baits.\u00a0In the Great Lakes, brown trout can offer outstanding sports in the early spring - often before other species begin to bite - to anglers who wade, fish from piers with live bait or artificial lures, or who troll in largely inshore water with imitation minnows or other plugs. Browns are often taken in conjunction with coho in the spring or incidentally with other salmon during the summer.Brown trout in streams are usually more cooperative on rainy or overcast days. Though they will take all manner of live bait as well as spinners or artificial minnows, brown trout are a favorite of fly fishermen, many of whom pursue them after dark during notable insect hatches, especially the giant Michigan mayfly (Hexagenia limbata). But large streamers and big splashy surface flies, such as mouse patterns, produce well, too.Some of Michigan's best known trout streams - such as the Au Sable, the Pere Marquette and the Manistee Rivers - are noted for their brown trout fisheries. Inland brown trout lakes include Higgins, Burt, Mullet, McCormick (near Atlanta) and Bear (Kalkaska County).\u00a0Review Fishing Guide for current rules and regulations \u00bbThe diet of adult brown trout includes insects and their larvae, crustaceans, mollusks, amphibians, small rodents and other fish.\u00a0In spring time you will find them in shallow, rocky, boulder-strewn areas, and they prefer a water temperature of 50-65 degrees F. Since brown trout spawn in tributary streams in September and October, they begin to take up residence near stream outlets in late summer to early fall. After ascending a particular stream, brown trout spawners choose shallow, gravelly or rocky areas. The female creates a shallow depression (redd) in the gravel, in which the spawning fish deposit the eggs and sperm. When the process is completed, the female covers the redd with gravel.Native to Europe and parts of Asia, brown trout were introduced to Michigan in 1883 - one of the first states to import them into North America - they now thrive statewide. Brown trout are more tolerant of warmer water temperatures than other trout species, and as a result, browns have become the principle target of anglers in many rivers across the state, ranging from Michigan's best-known trophy waters to small, marginal trout streams in southern Michigan.Did you know the DNR rears brown trout at Harrietta State Fish Hatchery and Oden State Fish Hatchery?",

Longnose suckers ascend rivers from mid-April to early May, depending on latitude. Maximum life expectancy for white suckers appears to be 17 years; it can be as long as 22-24 years for the longnose. Whites usually grow to be 12-20 inches long, while the longnoses grow to 15-25 inches.They are also found statewide in warm-water rivers and inland lakes. Longnose suckers prefer cold, deeper waters of the Great Lakes and have been found as deep as 600 feet in Lake Superior. The white sucker goes by a number of other names, including common sucker, coarse-scaled sucker, brook sucker, gray sucker, mud sucker, sucker, mullet, black mullet, slender sucker, june sucker, and white horse. The longnose sucker is sometimes called the sturgeon sucker because of its pronounced snout.Cyprinus carpio - scientific nameLight gold to dark brown in color with large scales covering entire body.

Lake Sturgeon have a large protrusible, suctorial mouth on the bottom side of the head with four barbels in front of the mouth and beneath the snout. The barbels are sensory organs that assist the sturgeon in finding prey on the river and lake bottoms. Lake Sturgeon have a single dorsal fin located far back near the caudal (tail) fin. The tail upper lobe is much larger than the rounded lower lobe. Lake Sturgeon have scales but not the cycloid scales associated with most bony fishes, rather they are covered by the much stronger ganoid scales. Juvenile Lake Sturgeon are a sandy brown color with black mottling and spots, while adults are olive-brown to grey with white underneath.Anglers who harvest a lake sturgeon must register their harvest within 24 hours (see below for registration options.\u00a0Lake sturgeon harvest is limited to one (1) per year per angler.

The lower fins are often orange to orange-red with a leading white edge. The darker colored back has a dorsal fin and an adipose fin. The tail\u00a0fin is deeply forked with equal sized upper and lower lobes. The anal fin has 8-10 rays with a leading white edge.\u00a0Lake trout prefer cold water and are often found at significant depths, though they can be taken in relatively shallow water in spring and fall. For the most part, lakers are caught by trolling anglers using spoons, flashers and flies or cowbells and minnows, often near bottom. Lake trout spawn in the fall, often on shoals and reefs but some migrate upstream creating angling opportunities on piers, where anglers fishing with spawn, smelt or minnows on the bottom or casting with spoons can sometimes connect.

Hybridization with other sunfish species (i.e., pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish) occurs, with resulting offspring exhibiting intermediate characteristics.This fish enjoys a well-deserved popularity with anglers. Many a young angler boasts the delicious bluegill as a first catch, while seasoned anglers using light tackle find it a valiant fighter. Bluegills favor warm waters (64 to 70 degrees F) with plenty of cover such as weed beds, submerged logs, or drop-offs. They usually stay in relatively shallow water, but as temperatures rise in the summer, large bluegills will head for deeper water. This fish also provides good winter sport since it remains active all winter long.\u00a0Review Fishing Guide for current rules and regulations \u00bbThe young fry eat zooplankton and algae. As they grow larger, bluegills add small fish, aquatic insects and some plant matter to their diet. The bluegill feeds off the surface of the water the midwaters and the bottom, where it can be a serious competitor with other bottom feeding fish.The sunfish family generally prefer warm water, and are nesting fishes. That is, the males scoop out a depression where one or more females deposit eggs. The males then fertilize and guard the eggs and the newly hatched young. The bluegill spawns in the shallows in the late spring or early summer when the water temperature reaches 65 degrees F. Males build nesting colonies in gravel, sand or mud and will guard the eggs and newly hatched fry until they reach the swimming stage.

Crowding results in stunted offspring that may never exceed a length of six inches; thus, a controlled harvest program can benefit both the angler and the fish themselves.\u00a0 When given the choice, perch prefer a water temperature of 66 to 70 degrees F and often they follow the 68 degree F water temperature levels during their seasonal movements.",
            "diet": "Adult perch dine primarily on immature insects, larger invertebrates, (crayfish) and the eggs and young of other fish, which they take both from open water and from the bottom.
